# Circle Recursion Zoom
Inspired by [Daniel Schiffman's vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPsZwrV9ld0) to build a zooming-in animation of a simple fractal composed of circles of decreasing size.

## Completed Features
- [x] Drawing the initial fractal with rotation.
- [x] Scaling up with time to create a zoom effect.
- [x] Setting the color of the circle based on its radius.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Make it more efficient by deleting/ignoring circles that expand beyond the canvas.
